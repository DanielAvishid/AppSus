## Overview

AppSus is a web application created during the Coding Academy's web development course project submissions. Mimicking Google Keep and Gmail applications, it stands as our first-ever React project, developed with just four days of learning. This endeavor also marked our initial exploration into collaborative development using Git, with contributions from DanielAvishid and OfirKaspi.
